    The dataset I chose to analyze is a collection of records of various diamonds, 
    their prices, and some of their physical properties. The dataset is provided by Shivam Agrawal
    and is publically accessible on Kaggle at: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds</a>. 
    A screenshot of that page is provided here as a data dictionary:

    The questions that I sought to answer was <strong>what are some of the general characteristics of the 
    diamond market and how do the 4 Cs (Cut, Color, Clarity, Carats) affect a diamond's price?</strong> 
    I wanted to focus on the 4 Cs rather than the size of the diamonds for two reasons. First, the 4 Cs are the 
    traditional way of evaluating diamonds. I thought it would be an interesting parallel to tie the traditions 
    of an old art, gemology, with a new art, data visualization. The second reason is more mundane; a diamond's weight 
    is somewhat correlated to its size measurements, which means there would be overlap and potentially collinearity 
    between the x, y, z, depth, and table variables and the carat variable. In the interest of concision I chose not 
    to focus on the size.

    My initial plan was to create a series of plots with the independent variable price on the y-axis 
    and each of the 4 Cs on the x-axis of their own graph. My thinking was that mapping too many features to a single 
    image would be overwhelming, especially since the dataset is so large. I quickly realized that this wasn't feasible, 
    since cut, clarity, and color are all categorical rather than continuous variables. From that initial idea, however, 
    I did settle on a scatterplot with carats on the x-axis. This ended up being the foundation of my final iteration.

    In fact, even this initial visualization revealed two interesting features of manufactured diamonds. First, I 
    expected that the distribution of carats would be mostly even, since diamonds naturally come in all shapes and 
    sizes. Instead, what I found was that the distribution tended to cluster around specific carat values. Diamonds 
    seem more likely to come in 0.7, 0.9, 1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.7, or 2 carat weights than in any of the gaps between those 
    values. That's not to say that diamonds <em>don't</em> come in other weights, but rather that they are focused 
    in those groupings. I surmise that those are standardized weights for particular sizes of jewelry, or maybe that 
    particular shapes trend towards particular weights.

    Second, the price of diamonds trends upwards with the weight of the diamond in carats. Unsurprising! Showing that 
    big diamonds are more expensive than small diamonds is hardly worth learning JavaScript for.
