    The dataset I chose to analyze is a collection of records of various diamonds, 
    their prices, and some of their physical properties. The dataset is provided by Shivam Agrawal
    and is publically accessible on Kaggle at: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds</a>. 
    A screenshot of that page is provided here as a data dictionary:
    </p>

    <p>
    The questions that I sought to answer were <strong>what are some of the general characteristics of the 
    diamond market and how do the 4 Cs (Cut, Color, Clarity, Carats) affect a diamond's price?</strong> 
    I wanted to focus on the 4 Cs rather than the size of the diamonds for two reasons. First, the 4 Cs are the 
    traditional way of evaluating diamonds. I thought it would be an interesting parallel to tie the traditions 
    of an old art, gemology, with a new art, data visualization. The second reason is more mundane; a diamond's weight 
    is somewhat correlated to its size measurements, which means there would be overlap and potentially collinearity 
    between the x, y, z, depth, and table variables and the carat variable. In the interest of concision I chose not 
    to focus on the dimensions.
    </p>

    <p>
    My initial plan was to create a series of plots with the independent variable price on the y-axis 
    and each of the 4 Cs on the x-axis of their own graph. My thinking was that mapping too many features to a single 
    image would be overwhelming, especially since the dataset is so large. I quickly realized that this wasn't feasible, 
    since cut, clarity, and color are all categorical rather than continuous variables. From that initial idea, however, 
    I did settle on a scatterplot with carats on the x-axis. This ended up being the foundation of my final iteration.
    </p>

    <p>
    In fact, even this initial visualization revealed two interesting features of manufactured diamonds. First, I 
    expected that the distribution of carats would be mostly even, since diamonds naturally come in all shapes and 
    sizes. Instead, what I found was that the distribution tended to cluster around specific carat values. Diamonds 
    seem more likely to come in 0.7, 0.9, 1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.7, or 2 carat weights than in any of the gaps between those 
    values. That's not to say that diamonds <em>don't</em> come in other weights, but rather that they are focused 
    in those groupings. I surmise that those are standardized weights for particular sizes of jewelry, or maybe that 
    particular shapes trend towards particular weights.
    </p>

    <img src="/dataviz/caratBands.png">

    <p>
    Second, the price of diamonds trends upwards with the weight of the diamond in carats. Unsurprising! Showing that 
    big diamonds are more expensive than small diamonds is hardly worth learning JavaScript. However, there are 
    several spots of noticeable variability in prices for diamonds of similar weights. For example, there is variance 
    within the standardized weight bands I pointed out in the previous paragraph. Since those diamonds aren't differentiated 
    by their weight, it makes sense that other factors affect the price. Similarly, above and below a certain threshold there 
    is little correlation between weight and price. This too makes sense, since very small and obscenely large diamonds 
    would have to differentiate themselves in other ways.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now that I had my scatterplot, the next issue was how to map the remaining categorical variables. My first idea, 
    which I ended up going with, was to map one of the variables to the color channel. I initially chose the variable 
    "color" (not to be confused with the color channel) simply out of curiosity. What I found was that there were some 
    interesting trends with respect to price and color. As you can see in the screenshot below, there are noticeably 
    distinct bands of color arcing through the graph. At the top of each bunch of carats you can see smatterings of 
    brown marks. Those are rated "D", the highest available color rating. Slightly below and mixed together are yellow 
    and orange marks corresponding to the next highest grades, "E" and "F". Interestingly, below these is a thick band 
    of red marks corresponding to the lowest color grade, "J". One can easily discern that the "J"-rated diamonds 
    consistently sell for higher prices than all three of the next higher color-rated diamonds. I hypothesize that this 
    is because that particular color lends itself stylistically to certain cuts or physically to certain levels of 
    clarity, so that will be the next target of my investigation.
    </p>

    <p>
    At this point I was thinking that I would map the cut and clarity variables to the shape and/or size channels and 
    include all of them on the same scatterplot. My thinking was that since I was most interested in the interactions 
    between the 4 Cs, having them all on the same view would make examining those interactions easier. I quickly realized 
    that this wasn't feasible. For one thing, there are so many marks that telling shapes apart would be extremely difficult, 
    especially in areas where there are lots of marks clustered together. The same issue is true for size, plus differentiating 
    sizes at that scale would be nearly impossible even if they were neatly lined up next to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
    Instead, I decided to make the graph clickable and have the click transition the color channel to the cut and clarity 
    variables in turn. This kept the x- and y-axes intact, which lent continuity which helps with examining the interactions. 
    It also meant I could use the D3 transition method to create an effect where the color channels would "melt" into each 
    other. I found that this also helped highlight the interactions, since the contrast caused the different properties 
    to pop out.
    </p>
    
    <img src="/dataviz/cutTrends.png">

    <p>
    The main takeaway from this view is that lots of diamonds have an ideal cut! The graph is flooded with red, 
    corresponding to the ideal cut. Interestingly, the diamonds that weigh less and are in the middle of their price 
    bands seem to have the highest concentration of ideal cuts. This indicates that jewelers may be less willing to 
    risk higher-quality diamonds by attempting to shape them perfectly, since those diamonds have other redeeming factors 
    that can keep their price up with less-than-ideal cuts. The plain diamonds of the batch, those that are small or 
    poorly-colored, are the ones that get the Cinderella treatment in the jewelers shop. The final question then 
    is how clarity affects the other factors. Once again, a click of the chart transitions the color channel to the clarity variable.
    </p>

    <img src="/dataviz/clarityTrends.png">

    <p>
    Once again, there are noticeable trends visible in the color channel. For diamonds below 0.9 carats, the highest-priced 
    marks are green, indicating the third-best grade of VS1. For all weights, the middle-to-lower tier of diamonds are 
    pink on the chart, corresponding to a higher grade of VVS2. There are distinct bands of green and red too, which 
    correspond to the fourth- and seventh-highest rated clarity scores. Simply put, while clarity clearly affects price, 
    higher clarity scores don't seem to correlate at all with higher prices. Instead, they seem to be more related to 
    stylistic preference and other exogenous factors that are stronger predictors of price. Putting together all of this 
    information, we can summarize the answers to our questions. There are definite trends in the diamond market, as evidenced 
    by the trends in the x-axis and color channels in all of the charts. However, those trends don't correspond to the 
    intuitive idea that the brightest, clearest, and most pristine diamonds sell for the highest prices. We come away with 
    a more nuanced understanding of diamonds, and hopefully a leg up the next time we go shopping.
