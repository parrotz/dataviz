    The dataset I chose to analyze is a collection of records of various diamonds, 
    their prices, and some of their physical properties. The dataset is provided by Shivam Agrawal
    and is publically accessible <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds">on Kaggle.</a> 
    A screenshot of that page is provided here as a data dictionary:

    The questions that I sought to answer was <strong>what are some of the general characteristics of the 
    diamond market and how do the 4 Cs (Cut, Color, Clarity, Carats) affect a diamond's price?</strong> 
    I wanted to focus on the 4 Cs rather than the size of the diamonds for two reasons. First, the 4 Cs are the 
    traditional way of evaluating diamonds. I thought it would be an interesting parallel to tie the traditions 
    of an old art, gemology, with a new art, data visualization. The second reason is more mundane; a diamond's weight 
    is somewhat correlated to its size measurements, which means there would be overlap and potentially collinearity 
    between the x, y, z, depth, and table variables and the carat variable. In the interest of concision I chose not 
    to focus on the size.
